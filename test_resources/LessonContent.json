The synapses that are involved with our\ndaily habits and routines are some of these strong synapses, for\nexample brushing your teeth or having a cup of tea in the morning. <br>\n<br>\nIt takes time to form new synapses, particularly as we get older and\nour adult brain is already wired strongly to the way we have been\nliving our lives. So rather than fighting the current, it’s better\nto go with it, and use the habits that we already have to help us\nbuild new ones. <br>\n<br>\nFor a new habit you want to implement, for example, remembering to\ntake your supplements daily, try doing this right after or just\nbefore a current habit you already have, such as when you eat your\nbreakfast. As you already have a breakfast routine established,\nusing this as a reminder to take your supplements right after will\nhelp you to remember to implement your new habit. Overtime, remember\nto take your supplements will become a thoughtless habit. <br>\n<br>",

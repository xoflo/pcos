        "answer": "Based on the current research we don’t think intermittent fasting\n(IF) is the best option for you. Whilst IF has become a very popular\nstyle of eating and many have seen health benefits with simply\nreducing their eating window, this doesn’t mean that this eating\npattern will result in the same benefits for you. The latest\nresearch is showing us how the timing of when we eat influences our\nhormones. The hormones that are really important for things like\novulation and PCOS symptoms are released in the morning, and&nbsp;\njust simply having a good breakfast can help ‘reset’ those hormones.\nOn top of this, breakfast is an important tool we have to help us\nmanage our insulin. Studies show that consuming more of our daily\ncalories earlier in the morning can significantly affect our hormone\nproduction associated with ovulation and our insulin responses. We\nrecommend eating breakfast within 1 hour of waking.&nbsp; <br>\n<br>\n<i>What is intermittent fasting?</i> IF is essentially reducing your\neating window each day, the most common pattern is an 8:16 split,\neating within an 8 hour window, and fasting (not eating) for the\nremaining 16 hours of the day. This typically means skipping\nbreakfast, eating around midday and having finished dinner by 8pm. <br>",

The research isn’t clear on whether they worsen insulin\nresistance or not, but this is for a lack of research being done on\npeople who have pre-existing insulin resistance.

        "answer": "You may have some concerns around cholesterol, particularly if\nyou’ve been told that you have high cholesterol or at risk of it.\nWhen we&#39;re looking at high cholesterol from a functional medicine\nperspective, we view high cholesterol as a symptom rather than a\ndisease itself. Some of the main reasons someone may have high\ncholesterol include: <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Genetics predisposition to having high cholesterol. Some\npeople have what’s called familial hypercholesterolemia</li>\n<li>Insulin resistance</li>\n<li>Gut infections like H. Pylori or other gut issues that cause\nintestinal permeability (which leads to chronic inflammation in\nthe body)</li>\n<li>Poor thyroid function like hypothyroidism (or even\nsub-clinical hypothyroidism, which is an early, mild form of\nhypothyroidism)</li>\n<li>Heavy metal toxicity</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIf you currently have high levels of cholesterol, we suggest working\non your root cause for at least the next 6 months to see if that\nhelps your cholesterol levels. If it does, great, that might be the\ndriver for you. If not, and it’s not familial hypercholesterolemia\nit might be worth looking into other causes.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>What about dietary changes for cholesterol?</i></b><br>\n<br>\nBack in the 90s, scientists thought that dietary cholesterol, such\nas in egg yolks, could increase your cholesterol in your body, but\nthat was disproven in the early 2000s. So don’t be afraid of eggs!\nThey’re a great source of protein, B6, B12, zinc, iron and copper.<br>\n<br>\n<i><b>Heart healthy fats </b></i><br>\n<br>\nFat is an essential nutrient in our diet, but not all fats act in\nthe same way in our body. Fats that have shown to be more protective\nfor our heart are unsaturated fats, these are monounsaturated and\npolyunsaturated. It’s good to focus on getting the majority of our\nfats from foods that are rich in unsaturated fats. <br>\nThis includes:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Avocados &amp; avocado oil</li>\n<li>Olives &amp; olive oils</li>\n<li>Nuts &amp; seeds</li>\n<li>Fatty fish such as salmon or trout </li>\n<li>Eggs </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nWe suggest reducing your intake of foods higher in saturated and\ntrans fats. Although only slightly different in structure to\nunsaturated fats, they have quite a different effect on our bodies.\n<br>\nFoods high in saturated fats include:<br>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Fatty cuts of meat or highly processed meats.</b> <i>Instead\nopt for leaner cuts of meat or trim meats.</i></li>\n<li><b>Coconut oil and coconut cream.</b> <i>Use moderately, or\nopt for olive oil or avocado oil or cashew cream.</i></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nBeing mindful of all highly processed and sugary foods can help with\ncholesterol management and overall heart health. <br>\n<br>\nIf cholesterol is an issue for you, remember to consult your health\nprofessional if you have any concerns or need more information\npertaining to your cholesterol and medical history.<br>\n<br>",

But for us with\nPCOS, it’s important we look into whether avoiding gluten is\nsomething we personally need to do in order to help our symptoms, as\nwe don’t want to cut out more food groups unnecessarily. <br>\n<br>\n<b>What is gluten?</b> It’s a protein molecule that is found in\nwheat, barley and rye and its derivatives. <br>\n<br>\nSymptoms of any level of sensitivity to gluten can include:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Constipation</li>\n<li>Diarrhea</li>\n<li>Abdominal pain and bloating</li>\n<li>Eczema</li>\n<li>Rashes</li>\n<li>Skin problems</li>\n<li>Migraines</li>\n<li>Brain fog</li>\n<li>Chronic fatigue</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nBut, you can have any or multiple of the above symptoms without\ngluten being the culprit. So even if you resonate with some of the\nabove symptoms, it’s also highly likely these could be caused by\nsomething else entirely.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are two different ‘streams’ of reactions to gluten:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Coeliac disease:</b> the autoimmune version of a gluten\nsensitivity. A serious form of gluten intolerance, one that can do\nreal damage to the tissues in the small intestine (important to note\nsymptoms aren’t always gut related, some people with coeliac don’t\nexperience any gastrointestinal issues).<br>\n<b>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS): </b>both intestinal and\nnon-digestive reactions to gluten that are not autoimmune or\nallergic in nature and resolve when you remove gluten from the diet.<br>\n<br>\nUnlike coeliac disease, we don’t know enough about NCGS and there’s\nno definitive testing that you can get done. Right now, the main way\nwe identify NCGS is by removing gluten for a period of at least 2\nmonths, then adding it back and monitoring how your body\nresponds.&nbsp; <br>\n<br>\nReasons you would need to look at removing gluten permanently:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Coeliac disease (you’ll strictly need to remove if diagnosed)</li>\n<li>Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)</li>\n<li>Endometriosis</li>\n<li>Thyroid issues like hypothyroidism</li>\n<li>Autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto’s thyroiditis</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nRemoving gluten isn’t a blanket rule we suggest because it’s not\nnecessarily the most important change for most women with PCOS. <br>\n<br>\nIt’s important to know you don’t necessarily have to remove gluten\nfor life either, as you may develop a better tolerance for gluten as\nyour health improves. So unless you have any of the suggested\nconditions, then don’t worry about cutting out gluten at this stage\nand just focus on following the changes you’ve been given. If you’ve\nalready removed gluten from your diet and feel much better, then you\ncan continue doing this. We just don’t want your diet to become\nunnecessarily restrictive. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Where can gluten be found? </b><br>\n<br>\nGluten is a component of wheat, barley and rye and is found in foods\nmade from these products. <br>\n<br>\nThese include: <br>\n<ul>\n<li>Wheat (and it’s varieties such as wheat berries, durum, emmer,\nsemolina, farro, freekeh, graham, KAMUT®, khorasan,\neinkorn)&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>\n<li>Rye </li>\n<li>Barley </li>\n<li>Triticale </li>\n<li>Malt (in its various forms such as malted barley flour, malted\nmilk or milkshakes, malt extract, malt syrup, malt flavoring,\nmalt vinegar) </li>\n<li>Brewer’s Yeast </li>\n<li>Wheat Starch</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<b>Note: </b>if you are coeliac cross-contamination can be a source\nof gluten when eating out, or from food outlets or companies that do\nnot have proper food safety standards in place. <br>\n<br>\n</body>",

        "question": "What are healthy fats?",
        "answer": " Fat is an essential nutrient in our diet, but not all fats act in\nthe same way in our body. Monounsaturated fats have been shown to be\nmore beneficial for both our PCOS symptoms and our overall health\ndue to their anti-inflammatory action. These are monounsaturated and\npolyunsaturated. It’s good to focus on getting the majority of our\nfats from foods that are rich in unsaturated fats. <br>\n<br>\nThis includes:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Avocados &amp; avocado oil</li>\n<li>Olives &amp; olive oils</li>\n<li>Nuts &amp; seeds</li>\n<li>Fatty fish such as salmon or trout </li>\n<li>Eggs </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nWe suggest reducing your intake of foods higher in saturated and\ntrans fats. Although only slightly different in structure to\nunsaturated fats, they have shown to have an inflammatory effect on\nour bodies, which affects both our PCOS symptoms and our overall\nhealth. <br>\n<br>\nFoods high in saturated fats include:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Fatty cuts of meat or highly processed meats.<i> Instead opt\nfor leaner cuts of meat or trim meats.</i></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Coconut oil and coconut cream. <i>Use moderately, or opt for\nolive oil or avocado oil or cashew cream.</i></li>\n</ul>\nHighly processed foods such as frozen desserts, fast foods, many\nbakery products, candy bars, ‘instant’ foods, and processed meats. <br>",

        "question": "What is fiber (or dietary fiber)? ",
        "answer": " <p>Dietary fiber is part of a plant cell; a carbohydrate that our\nbody can’t break down and digest. fiber travels the whole way\nthrough our digestive tract and out the other end, meaning fiber\ndoesn’t actually provide us with energy. <br>\n</p>\n<p><i>That doesn’t mean it doesn’t do us any good though! </i><br>\n</p>\n<p><b>Fiber plays an important role in:</b><b><br>\n</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Promoting good cholesterol levels</b></li>\n<li><b>Stabilizing blood sugar </b></li>\n<li><b>Aiding digestion and gut health</b><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>\nAlthough we can’t absorb fiber and utilize it as energy, our gut\nmicrobiota can - they thrive in an environment rich in fiber. Our\ngut bacteria partially metabolize fiber (also known as <b>prebiotics</b>)\nwhich helps them to proliferate. In this process they make a\nbyproduct (short chain fatty acids) which have shown to be really\nbeneficial for our gut, immune system and more. <i>Sign me\nup!&nbsp; </i><br>\n<b><br>\n</b><b>Top tip: </b>Only plant foods contain fiber. As well, any\nfood processing can strip foods of their fiber content. <br>\n</p>\n<p>Whole foods <i>(that haven&#39;t been or are only minimally\nprocessed)</i> like vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes and\nnuts and seeds are all great sources of fiber. <br>\n<br>\n</p>",

As your baby gets\nolder and sleeps through the night, make sure that you&#39;re timing\nyour sleep accordingly. If they&#39;re going to bed at 6PM, they&#39;ll\nbe up relatively early. If you’re not asleep until 11PM but\nyou&#39;re getting woken up at 5AM, then you’re only getting 6 hours\nsleep. <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Try split feeding and sleeping shifts with your partner. <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Say your baby generally needs to feed at say 8PM and again at\n12AM. You can do that 8PM feed and also have some expressed milk\nset aside. Then go to bed straight after that and get your\npartner to use the expressed milk for a feed at 12AM and then he\ngoes to bed and sleeps through to 7AM. Anecdotally, this half\nhalf approach can work quite well in practice.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Plan tasks ahead.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>To allow yourself more time in the evening for winding down,\naim to fit more tasks in during the day where you can, rather\nthan banking them up to do after you’ve put the baby/child to\nsleep. <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Delegate, delegate, delegate! <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Accepting help and sharing the workload (even if just\ninitially) is so beneficial to get you through this period.\nDelegate as much life admin as you can to family and friends\n(and paid specialists where possible). <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Ask yourself: “how could I make this a priority?”, “What am I\ndoing at the moment, where I could swap in sleep?”, “Is there\nanyone else who can help me with this task or take it off my\nplate?”</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<b>Just remember: </b>There’s no such thing as perfection when it\ncomes to babies and sleep, they just don’t go hand in hand!

One study found that oral contraceptives almost doubled\nthe time it takes to metabolize caffeine (10 hours vs. six hours).\nSo if you’re genetically a slow metabolizer of caffeine and you’re\non HBC, you’ve got a double whammy and have caffeine floating around\nin your body for much longer.<br>",

Contrary to\npopular belief, there is no evidence to suggest limiting eggs is\nnecessary for cholesterol. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Whole food soybean products:</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Tofu</b> (soybean curd) is a great source of protein meaning it\nhelps to keep us feeling fuller for longer. It’s a good source of\ncalcium and iron as well. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Tempeh</b> (fermented soybeans) is also a good source of protein,\nand it is a fermented food meaning it delivers slightly more\nnutrients, fiber and protein than tofu. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Edamame beans</b> (immature soybeans) deliver both protein and\ncarbohydrates. For this reason, they’re not as rich in protein as\ntofu or tempeh, instead similar to other legumes, so to reach the\nsame protein intake your serving size will need to be a little\nbigger, or pair with another protein source.&nbsp; <br>\n<br>\n<b>Legumes (</b>e.g chickpeas, kidney beans, cannellini beans,\nlentils, peas) all deliver protein, however they also deliver\ncarbohydrates as edamame beans do (assume about 50:50 ratio). For\nthis reason you may need to be mindful of your portion to reach\nenough protein. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Dairy</b> can be a great vegetarian source of protein,\nparticularly cheeses like halloumi, cottage cheese, feta, ricotta,\nyogurt or mozzarella for example. However, dairy can also aggravate\nacne or inflammation/inflammatory conditions. For this reason,\nlooking primarily to dairy for your protein might not have the best\noutcome. If dairy doesn’t aggravate acne or inflammation for you,\nincluding a dairy protein source is fine. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Quinoa</b> is classified as a whole grain ‘carb’ but it also\nprovides a reasonable amount of protein (that’s because it’s\ntechnically a seed). Handy hint: pairing a legume with a quinoa can\nbe a good way to achieve both your protein and carb servings in a\nmeal.&nbsp; <br>\n<b><br>\n</b><b>Hemp and chia seeds </b>do deliver protein, however they are\nprimarily a source of beneficial fats. For this reason, to achieve a\nreasonable serving of protein from these seeds you need a large\nportion, which also will deliver a reasonable amount of calories, so\nsomething to be mindful of. <br>\n<br>\n<br>",

        "answer": " You may get advice from your doctor or online to have intercourse\nbetween Days 10 and 17 of your cycle. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, one study that followed 221 women for three to four months\nfound that only 30 percent of women have their fertile window\nbetween these days. The guidelines of Days 10 to 17 being your\n“primetime” are based on the assumption that you ovulate 14 days\nbefore you get your period. But this study showed that this wasn’t\nthe case at all. Only 10 percent of the women who had a 28-day cycle\ngot their period 14 days after ovulation, and the range was actually\n7 to 19 days! For those of us with PCOS and more-irregular cycles,\nthis variability is even greater.&nbsp; What we ACTUALLY need to be\ndoing, is having intercourse when we’re in our fertile window. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you’re having difficulty interpreting your charts, set up an\nappointment with your expert to help you go through your charts and\nidentify your fertile window. <br>\n<br>\n<br>",

        "question": "How much protein should I be aiming for in a day?",
        "answer": "There is no exact amount of protein overall to be having in a day. There’s\na recommended daily intake of protein (RDA/RDI) which is the amount\nof protein that you need to get to avoid protein malnutrition.\nThat’s about 0.8-1 gram of protein per kg of body weight per day.\nYou probably don’t need us to tell you that avoiding protein\nmalnutrition is NOT the same thing as an optimal amount of protein\nper day. For example, people that want to build muscle mass will be\naiming for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per\nday, which is about 2g per kg of body weight. <br>\n<br>\nSo, for that person, say they’re 80kg, would instead want to be\nhaving around 160g of protein a day - which is a huge amount. So\nthis is where we generally say for most people it&#39;s around somewhere\nin between the RDA/RDI and that recommended amount in order to gain\nmuscle mass, so generally around 1.2-1.4g per kg of body weight per\nday. \"<br>",

This is because\ncollagen is not what we call a complete protein, it&#39;s missing one of\nyour key amino acids: tryptophan. Tryptophan is important for your\nbrain’s neurotransmitters to work properly.

        "answer": "Ovarian cysts are (contrary to popular belief) not caused by PCOS. Ovarian\ncysts (pathological cysts) are large fluid filled sacs that can burst and cause immense pain. They can also grow very large and block the blood supply in the ovaries. Pathological cysts are cysts caused by abnormal cell growth and are not related to the menstrual cycle or the PCOS ‘functional cysts’. Pathological cysts develop from either the cells used to create eggs or the cells that cover the outer part of the ovary. Pathological cysts are usually non-cancerous. <br>\n<br>\nThe ‘cysts’ (functional cysts) that are found on the ovaries in PCOS aren’t really cysts at all. These are ‘follicles’ or baby eggs that just haven’t ‘hatched’ when you couldn’t ovulate, i.e. they have a function which was meant to release an egg. <br>\n<br>\nYou can have BOTH an ovarian cyst and PCOS - but just because you have PCOS doesn’t mean you’ll have an ovarian cyst and if you have ovarian cysts, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you have PCOS.<br>",

If you&#39;re\nseeing increases in the wet cervical mucus on, say, day 10 and again\non day 20, what this will mean is that your body has been trying to\novulate on day 10 and it hasn&#39;t quite reached ovulation.

Your body releases an egg and increases your basal body temperature to incubate it, so it can&#39;t be used to predict the lead up to ovulation.

Consider using a slow-cooker, stewing, braising or poaching for at least 30 days. <br>\n- Vegetables should be well-cooked with any seeds removed to improve digestibility; minimize your intake of raw, fibrous fruits and vegetables. <br>\n- Be very careful when eating out, and consider calling ahead to ask about preparation methods and ingredients to find an option that works for you.<br>\n<br>\nRemember that low FODMAP isn&#39;t a permanent diet - you will need to reintroduce to identify what foods trigger you.\"<br>\n<br>",

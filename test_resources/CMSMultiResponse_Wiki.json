            "body": "You may have some concerns around cholesterol, particularly if\nyou’ve been told that you have high cholesterol or at risk of it.\nWhen we&#39;re looking at high cholesterol from a functional medicine\nperspective, we view high cholesterol as a symptom rather than a\ndisease itself. Some of the main reasons someone may have high\ncholesterol include: <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Genetics predisposition to having high cholesterol. Some\npeople have what’s called familial hypercholesterolemia</li>\n<li>Insulin resistance</li>\n<li>Gut infections like H. Pylori or other gut issues that cause\nintestinal permeability (which leads to chronic inflammation in\nthe body)</li>\n<li>Poor thyroid function like hypothyroidism (or even\nsub-clinical hypothyroidism, which is an early, mild form of\nhypothyroidism)</li>\n<li>Heavy metal toxicity</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIf you currently have high levels of cholesterol, we suggest working\non your root cause for at least the next 6 months to see if that\nhelps your cholesterol levels. If it does, great, that might be the\ndriver for you. If not, and it’s not familial hypercholesterolemia\nit might be worth looking into other causes.<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>What about dietary changes for cholesterol?</i></b><br>\n<br>\nBack in the 90s, scientists thought that dietary cholesterol, such\nas in egg yolks, could increase your cholesterol in your body, but\nthat was disproven in the early 2000s. So don’t be afraid of eggs!\nThey’re a great source of protein, B6, B12, zinc, iron and copper.<br>\n<br>\n<i><b>Heart healthy fats </b></i><br>\n<br>\nFat is an essential nutrient in our diet, but not all fats act in\nthe same way in our body. Fats that have shown to be more protective\nfor our heart are unsaturated fats, these are monounsaturated and\npolyunsaturated. It’s good to focus on getting the majority of our\nfats from foods that are rich in unsaturated fats. <br>\nThis includes:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Avocados &amp; avocado oil</li>\n<li>Olives &amp; olive oils</li>\n<li>Nuts &amp; seeds</li>\n<li>Fatty fish such as salmon or trout </li>\n<li>Eggs </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nWe suggest reducing your intake of foods higher in saturated and\ntrans fats. Although only slightly different in structure to\nunsaturated fats, they have quite a different effect on our bodies.\n<br>\nFoods high in saturated fats include:<br>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Fatty cuts of meat or highly processed meats.</b> <i>Instead\nopt for leaner cuts of meat or trim meats.</i></li>\n<li><b>Coconut oil and coconut cream.</b> <i>Use moderately, or\nopt for olive oil or avocado oil or cashew cream.</i></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nBeing mindful of all highly processed and sugary foods can help with\ncholesterol management and overall heart health. <br>\n<br>\nIf cholesterol is an issue for you, remember to consult your health\nprofessional if you have any concerns or need more information\npertaining to your cholesterol and medical history.<br>\n<br>",

Contrary to\npopular belief, there is no evidence to suggest limiting eggs is\nnecessary for cholesterol. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Whole food soybean products:</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Tofu</b> (soybean curd) is a great source of protein meaning it\nhelps to keep us feeling fuller for longer. It’s a good source of\ncalcium and iron as well. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Tempeh</b> (fermented soybeans) is also a good source of protein,\nand it is a fermented food meaning it delivers slightly more\nnutrients, fiber and protein than tofu. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Edamame beans</b> (immature soybeans) deliver both protein and\ncarbohydrates. For this reason, they’re not as rich in protein as\ntofu or tempeh, instead similar to other legumes, so to reach the\nsame protein intake your serving size will need to be a little\nbigger, or pair with another protein source.&nbsp; <br>\n<br>\n<b>Legumes (</b>e.g chickpeas, kidney beans, cannellini beans,\nlentils, peas) all deliver protein, however they also deliver\ncarbohydrates as edamame beans do (assume about 50:50 ratio). For\nthis reason you may need to be mindful of your portion to reach\nenough protein. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Dairy</b> can be a great vegetarian source of protein,\nparticularly cheeses like halloumi, cottage cheese, feta, ricotta,\nyogurt or mozzarella for example. However, dairy can also aggravate\nacne or inflammation/inflammatory conditions. For this reason,\nlooking primarily to dairy for your protein might not have the best\noutcome. If dairy doesn’t aggravate acne or inflammation for you,\nincluding a dairy protein source is fine. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Quinoa</b> is classified as a whole grain ‘carb’ but it also\nprovides a reasonable amount of protein (that’s because it’s\ntechnically a seed). Handy hint: pairing a legume with a quinoa can\nbe a good way to achieve both your protein and carb servings in a\nmeal.&nbsp; <br>\n<b><br>\n</b><b>Hemp and chia seeds </b>do deliver protein, however they are\nprimarily a source of beneficial fats. For this reason, to achieve a\nreasonable serving of protein from these seeds you need a large\nportion, which also will deliver a reasonable amount of calories, so\nsomething to be mindful of. <br>\n<br>\n<br>",

High insulin is a common cause of this. Other additional\ncauses include coagulation disorders, thyroid disease, fibroids,\nuterine polyps, adenomyosis and endometriosis. If you think you may\nhave any of the additional causes, please seek the advice of your\ndoctor and/or gynaecologist. Another common reason for heavy\nmenstrual bleeding is the copper IUD, however this tends to settle\ndown around six months after insertion.<br>",

On top of this, caffeine\ncan affect our insulin sensitivity.

Consider using a slow-cooker, stewing, braising or poaching for at least 30 days. <br>\n- Vegetables should be well-cooked with any seeds removed to improve digestibility; minimize your intake of raw, fibrous fruits and vegetables. <br>\n- Be very careful when eating out, and consider calling ahead to ask about preparation methods and ingredients to find an option that works for you.<br>\n<br>\nRemember that low FODMAP isn&#39;t a permanent diet - you will need to reintroduce to identify what foods trigger you.\"<br>\n<br>",

            "body": " Gluten and PCOS is a very controversial topic, but unfortunately\nthere isn&#39;t a huge amount of research at the moment. But for us with\nPCOS, it’s important we look into whether avoiding gluten is\nsomething we personally need to do in order to help our symptoms, as\nwe don’t want to cut out more food groups unnecessarily. <br>\n<br>\n<b>What is gluten?</b> It’s a protein molecule that is found in\nwheat, barley and rye and its derivatives. <br>\n<br>\nSymptoms of any level of sensitivity to gluten can include:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Constipation</li>\n<li>Diarrhea</li>\n<li>Abdominal pain and bloating</li>\n<li>Eczema</li>\n<li>Rashes</li>\n<li>Skin problems</li>\n<li>Migraines</li>\n<li>Brain fog</li>\n<li>Chronic fatigue</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nBut, you can have any or multiple of the above symptoms without\ngluten being the culprit. So even if you resonate with some of the\nabove symptoms, it’s also highly likely these could be caused by\nsomething else entirely.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are two different ‘streams’ of reactions to gluten:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Coeliac disease:</b> the autoimmune version of a gluten\nsensitivity. A serious form of gluten intolerance, one that can do\nreal damage to the tissues in the small intestine (important to note\nsymptoms aren’t always gut related, some people with coeliac don’t\nexperience any gastrointestinal issues).<br>\n<b>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS): </b>both intestinal and\nnon-digestive reactions to gluten that are not autoimmune or\nallergic in nature and resolve when you remove gluten from the diet.<br>\n<br>\nUnlike coeliac disease, we don’t know enough about NCGS and there’s\nno definitive testing that you can get done. Right now, the main way\nwe identify NCGS is by removing gluten for a period of at least 2\nmonths, then adding it back and monitoring how your body\nresponds.&nbsp; <br>\n<br>\nReasons you would need to look at removing gluten permanently:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Coeliac disease (you’ll strictly need to remove if diagnosed)</li>\n<li>Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)</li>\n<li>Endometriosis</li>\n<li>Thyroid issues like hypothyroidism</li>\n<li>Autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto’s thyroiditis</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nRemoving gluten isn’t a blanket rule we suggest because it’s not\nnecessarily the most important change for most women with PCOS. <br>\n<br>\nIt’s important to know you don’t necessarily have to remove gluten\nfor life either, as you may develop a better tolerance for gluten as\nyour health improves. So unless you have any of the suggested\nconditions, then don’t worry about cutting out gluten at this stage\nand just focus on following the changes you’ve been given. If you’ve\nalready removed gluten from your diet and feel much better, then you\ncan continue doing this. We just don’t want your diet to become\nunnecessarily restrictive. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Where can gluten be found? </b><br>\n<br>\nGluten is a component of wheat, barley and rye and is found in foods\nmade from these products. <br>\n<br>\nThese include: <br>\n<ul>\n<li>Wheat (and it’s varieties such as wheat berries, durum, emmer,\nsemolina, farro, freekeh, graham, KAMUT®, khorasan,\neinkorn)&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>\n<li>Rye </li>\n<li>Barley </li>\n<li>Triticale </li>\n<li>Malt (in its various forms such as malted barley flour, malted\nmilk or milkshakes, malt extract, malt syrup, malt flavoring,\nmalt vinegar) </li>\n<li>Brewer’s Yeast </li>\n<li>Wheat Starch</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<b>Note: </b>if you are coeliac cross-contamination can be a source\nof gluten when eating out, or from food outlets or companies that do\nnot have proper food safety standards in place. <br>\n<br>\n</body>",

Whilst IF has become a very popular\nstyle of eating and many have seen health benefits with simply\nreducing their eating window, this doesn’t mean that this eating\npattern will result in the same benefits for you. The latest\nresearch is showing us how the timing of when we eat influences our\nhormones. The hormones that are really important for things like\novulation and PCOS symptoms are released in the morning, and&nbsp;\njust simply having a good breakfast can help ‘reset’ those hormones.\nOn top of this, breakfast is an important tool we have to help us\nmanage our insulin. Studies show that consuming more of our daily\ncalories earlier in the morning can significantly affect our hormone\nproduction associated with ovulation and our insulin responses. We\nrecommend eating breakfast within 1 hour of waking.&nbsp; <br>\n<br>\n<i>What is intermittent fasting?</i> IF is essentially reducing your\neating window each day, the most common pattern is an 8:16 split,\neating within an 8 hour window, and fasting (not eating) for the\nremaining 16 hours of the day. This typically means skipping\nbreakfast, eating around midday and having finished dinner by 8pm. <br>",

But the combination of\nmyo and d-chiro is more effective not only for insulin, but also for\nsupporting ovulation and overall ovarian health. <br>\n<br>\nStudies have shown that inositol is the most effective supplement\nfor insulin resistance in PCOS, and a 2019 analysis of the research\nfound it to be as effective as metformin for improving insulin.\nHowever this doesn’t mean you have to choose - you can take both!<br>",

As your baby gets\nolder and sleeps through the night, make sure that you&#39;re timing\nyour sleep accordingly. If they&#39;re going to bed at 6PM, they&#39;ll\nbe up relatively early. If you’re not asleep until 11PM but\nyou&#39;re getting woken up at 5AM, then you’re only getting 6 hours\nsleep. <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Try split feeding and sleeping shifts with your partner. <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Say your baby generally needs to feed at say 8PM and again at\n12AM. You can do that 8PM feed and also have some expressed milk\nset aside. Then go to bed straight after that and get your\npartner to use the expressed milk for a feed at 12AM and then he\ngoes to bed and sleeps through to 7AM. Anecdotally, this half\nhalf approach can work quite well in practice.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Plan tasks ahead.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>To allow yourself more time in the evening for winding down,\naim to fit more tasks in during the day where you can, rather\nthan banking them up to do after you’ve put the baby/child to\nsleep. <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Delegate, delegate, delegate! <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Accepting help and sharing the workload (even if just\ninitially) is so beneficial to get you through this period.\nDelegate as much life admin as you can to family and friends\n(and paid specialists where possible). <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Ask yourself: “how could I make this a priority?”, “What am I\ndoing at the moment, where I could swap in sleep?”, “Is there\nanyone else who can help me with this task or take it off my\nplate?”</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<b>Just remember: </b>There’s no such thing as perfection when it\ncomes to babies and sleep, they just don’t go hand in hand! It’s\nabout not beating yourself up and implementing what you can when you\ncan. <br>",
